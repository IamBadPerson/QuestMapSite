## ⚔️ What is QuestMap?

**QuestMap** transforms your daily walks into epic adventures across fantasy worlds. Instead of just tracking steps, you'll journey through **the Sword Coast**, **Middle-earth**, and **Narnia** — walking where legends once tread.

The concept is simple:

> *What if your daily walk could feel like a quest?*

Not a grind. Not a leaderboard race.
A **journey** — one that rewards consistency, curiosity, and imagination.

## 🧭 Why Choose QuestMap?

Unlike fitness apps that focus on performance metrics, QuestMap focuses on *purpose* and storytelling.
Every walk becomes part of your personal saga — unfolding across the maps and myths that sparked your imagination.

* **Walk for your health. Travel for your soul.**
* **See your movement as a journey, not a metric.**
* **Turn daily steps into living stories.**

QuestMap reimagines the act of moving through the world — reminding us that adventure begins the moment we step outside.

## 🚀 How Your Adventure Works

### 🏥 Automatic Step Tracking
Your journey starts effortlessly with Health Connect integration for Android devices. QuestMap automatically syncs your steps from fitness apps, managing everything in the background while preserving your battery life. No manual logging required — just walk, and watch your progress unfold.

### 🎯 Personalized Journey Management  
Set your own adventure timeline with custom journey start times. Once you begin, your route locks in to prevent accidental changes, and your progress persists even when you close the app. Every step is remembered, every milestone preserved.

### 🎨 Immersive Fantasy Experience
Navigate through a beautifully designed interface with fantasy-inspired themes and visual progress indicators. Watch milestone markers light up as you advance, with smooth animations that make every achievement feel magical.

## 🌠 Start Your Adventure

Whether you're walking to Mordor, Waterdeep, or just around the block — every step counts. Every road holds meaning. Every adventurer has a story worth telling.
