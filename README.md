# 🌍 QuestMap: Turning Every Step into a Story

> “Every journey begins with a single step — and some steps take you to new worlds.”

## ⚔️ A Passion Project Born from Adventure

**QuestMap** isn’t a corporate fitness app.
It’s a *passion project* — built by people who grew up tracing the routes of heroes across the pages of maps and novels. People who saw walking not as exercise, but as *exploration* — a way to feel closer to those distant worlds we loved.

The spark was simple:

> *What if your daily walk could feel like a quest?*

Not a grind. Not a leaderboard race.
A **journey** — one that rewards consistency, curiosity, and imagination.

QuestMap transforms every step into progress across worlds like **the Sword Coast**, **Middle-earth**, and **Narnia** — letting you walk where legends once tread.

## 🏞️ The Heart Behind the Code

QuestMap began as an idea sketched in a notebook and built late at night — an attempt to bridge two passions: **fantasy storytelling** and **real-world motion**.

It’s not designed to sell you subscriptions or ads.
It’s designed to **inspire movement through meaning** — to let you see progress not as numbers, but as *miles along your own adventure*.

> “The Realms are a world of a thousand stories — and I just tell a few of them.”
> — *Ed Greenwood, creator of the Forgotten Realms*

That line lives at the heart of QuestMap.
Every person who opens the app adds one more journey to that world of stories — a single traveler mapping their tale across the same shared horizon.

## 🧭 What Makes QuestMap Different

While most fitness apps focus on performance, QuestMap focuses on *purpose*.
It transforms every walk into a piece of your personal saga — one that unfolds across the maps and myths that shaped your imagination.

* **Walk for your health. Travel for your soul.**
* **See your movement as a journey, not a metric.**
* **Turn daily steps into living stories.**

QuestMap reimagines the act of moving through the world — reminding us that adventure begins the moment we step outside.

## 🧙 Built by Fans, for Adventurers

This is an **independent project**, made by storytellers, hikers, gamers, and dreamers who believe that small steps can lead to great tales.

It’s for:

* The **Ranger** who tracks every step like a trail marker.
* The **Scholar** who loves lore as much as landscapes.
* The **Adventurer** who wants their walks to *mean something.*

Every feature — from the Sword Coast routes to the glowing milestones — was built with care, for those who still believe in the magic of maps.

## 🛠️ The Oath We Walk By

No paywalls.
No tracking beyond your journey.
No competition that takes the joy from the road.

Just your path, your pace, and your progress — **mapped across the worlds that shaped your imagination.**

QuestMap will always remain open, honest, and crafted with heart — a reminder that **every traveler has a story worth telling.**
